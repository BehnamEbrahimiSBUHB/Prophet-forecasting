The sources provide guidance on setting cross-validation parameters for Prophet models, but they do not describe a method for automatically determining the *number* of cross-validation parameters. However, the sources do detail how to set and understand the existing cross-validation parameters, and how to choose values that are appropriate for your data.

Here is a breakdown of the key cross-validation parameters and how to choose them:

*   **`horizon`**: This parameter specifies the **forecast horizon**, which is how far into the future you are making predictions. The `horizon` should be chosen based on the length of predictions that you are interested in evaluating.
*   **`initial`**: This parameter sets the **initial training period**. This should be long enough to capture the key components of the model, including seasonalities and extra regressors. Specifically:
    *   At least one year of data is needed to capture yearly seasonality.
    *   At least one week of data is needed to capture weekly seasonality.
    *   It should also be long enough to capture the effect of any extra regressors in the model.
    *   By default the initial training period is set to three times the horizon.
*   **`period`**: This parameter determines the **spacing between cutoff dates**, which are the points in the time series where the model is trained and predictions are made.
    *   By default, cutoffs are made every half of the horizon.
    *   The `period` argument in Python and R must be a type that is accepted by Pandas Timedelta (Python) or as.difftime (R). In Python, this accepts units of days or shorter and in R this accepts units of weeks or shorter.
    *   You can also specify a list of custom cutoff dates to be used, rather than use a regular interval.

**Key Considerations When Choosing Cross-Validation Parameters**:

*   **Purpose of Cross-Validation:** The main purpose of cross-validation is to evaluate the model's performance by simulating historical forecasts. This means that you should pick a `horizon` that is relevant to your goals, for example if you are interested in assessing forecast performance one month into the future, then the `horizon` parameter should be set to one month.
*   **Data Characteristics**: The `initial` parameter needs to be set according to the characteristics of the time series. For example, if the data shows yearly seasonality then you should use at least one year of data.
*   **Computational Cost:** Shorter periods, or a larger number of cutoffs, will increase the number of model fits that need to be performed and therefore the computation time. This may need to be considered for very large datasets.
*  **Default Values:** The default values are often reasonable, with the `initial` parameter set to three times the `horizon` and cutoffs every half a `horizon`. You may use these defaults as a starting point.
*  **Custom Cutoffs**: If you have specific times you're interested in testing the model against, or specific evaluation periods, you can set those dates manually using the `cutoffs` parameter.

While the sources do not provide a method for automatically determining the number of cross-validation parameters, the parameter values can be chosen to allow you to evaluate model performance effectively, given the properties of your data and your forecasting goals. In particular, the `horizon` parameter should be set according to the forecast distance you are interested in. The `initial` parameter should be set based on the amount of data you need to capture your model's key components, and the `period` parameter controls the spacing of the evaluation cutoffs.
